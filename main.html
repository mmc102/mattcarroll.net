                                    <h4><strong>Spray</strong></h4>

                                    <p>There are a few quintessential photos of the crux pitch of The Opal on the internet â€” wispy white lines propagating across a panel of dark, lichen-covered granite. Over the years, I've seen these photos and always thought it would be a cool route to try.</p>

                                    <p>Last year in Squamish, I had hoped to get on the route with Luke, who was working on rebolting it. Ultimately, I had a relatively heinous trip, working way too much and stress-climbing at night.</p>

                                    <p>Fast forward to this year; I had plenty of time to try the route myself. I had a rather pathetic day attempting to get to the top of the wall and drop a rope. I got pitted riding a moss wave off a slab, thought I found the top, had the pleasure of hauling my rope out, and jugging 60m of vertical trees when I realized I was not on the route. I lazily coiled the rope and then immensely regretted it when the rope got tangled trying to rappel into what was <em>actually</em> The Opal.</p>

                                    <p>I spent the next three days top-rope soloing the route. As part of my hardness training, I didn't take any rest days and didn't tape my fingertips. This predictability yielded a nice split, which was essential to my plan of getting two rest days.</p>

                                    <p>I considered asking a few people to support me, but ultimately decided that the pressure of getting supported was a bit too high. I realized I could try to lead rope solo the route and figured I would give that a go before involving someone else.</p>

                                    <p>(Brent has a great <a href="https://www.brentbarghahn.com/climbing-blog/redpoint-rope-soloing-2021">blog post</a> about his lead rope solo setup, and I literally just copied and pasted his method.)</p>

                                    <p>I started around 4 PM after work and hiked to the base. There was a massive queue of people at Rock On, which was a bit of a bummer. Faffing in the public eye is markedly worse than faffing in solitude.</p>

                                    <p>Luke aced a nice sandbag on pitch one, claiming it was a "30m" pitch on Mountain Project. I dutifully tied my rope off at 40m, which fell short of the anchor, but luckily there was an anchor off to the right where I could stop.</p>

                                    <p>After some ado, I began the first "hard" pitch. I was nervous because the whole rope system was still pretty new to me, and it has gear that's tenuous to place and almost impossible to evaluate. Perfectly, a companion from Rock On honed in on this moment to ask some critical questions:</p>

                                    <p>"Hey, RopeSolo guy, is that <em>Merci Me</em>?"</p>

                                    <p>"Hey, RopeSolo guy, what route is that?"</p>

                                    <p>"Hey, RopeSolo guy with no shirt on"...</p>

                                    <p>Luckily, he gave up on me when he managed to turn on his Bluetooth speaker and play "Like A Virgin" for everyone in the South Gully. In yet another stroke of luck, he didn't subject us to Madonna's drab voice but instead played his incredibly tasteful rendition.</p>

                                    <p>Aside from that, the pitch went fine, and I completed the down-climb next without any issues.</p>

                                    <p>The crux pitch also went extremely well. There is potential for a bad-ish ledge fall on the crux moves, and my strategy for this was to leave a decent chunk of rope out in hopes of being able to jump over the ledge. I had traded my warm-up shoes that I was using for rope soloing (new Boostics â€” think Ford Focus) for the Ferraris of climbing footwear â€” a mint pair of original Boostics. Normally, they make a pitch of that style at least one number grade easier, and I was shook by how massive the feet felt underfoot. I had to churn the butter a bit at the last boulder on the pitch to grab the jug, but ultimately it all felt nice and controlled.</p>

                                    <p>The final two pitches went off without any real charades. At this point, I felt dialed in on the rope solo setup, but my elbows were hurting from all the jugging with a backpack. Fortunately, they are more or less entirely slab climbing, so my arms were of little service to the effort anyway.</p>

                                    <p>I uneventfully topped out and laughed to myself, trying to decide if this was just another day of climbing or if I had just done something that would be notable in my climbing career. In hindsight, I think that was a perfect process for a route like that, and I'm glad it happened. It was notable enough for me to want to write about it so that I can reference the day without strictly relying on my brain-laundered memories, but really, nobody should care.</p>

                                    <h4><strong>The Emotional Stuff</strong></h4>

                                    <p>In the past, I've used soloing as a way to "rebuild" my relationship with myself. Forcing self-belief by exposing myself to really high stakes felt unhealthy but generally effective. This experience felt motivated by a similar desire to get reacquainted with myself, but I think this was healthier. I hope this signals some kind of emotional growth.</p>

                                    <p>I've allowed climbing to obliterate so many things I have loved, yet it provides me with unmatched joy and fervor for life that I will continue to be unwilling to change my relationship with it.</p>

                                    <h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
                                    <p>For my setup to work, I generally optimize for:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Reliable internet (averaging 1-2 Zoom calls per day)</li>
                                        <li>Good access to climbing</li>
                                        <li>A reasonable place to park the van at night</li>
                                        <li>Weather</li>
                                        <li>Community</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    <div class="attempt-desc">
                                        <p>I have Starlink, which has been working well for internet, but it still feels a bit unreliable for days with important meetings. It seems like most calls I make have momentary periods of instability, especially during times with many other people and screen sharing.</p>

                                        <p>Luckily, there are a few coworking spaces in town. Iâ€™ve been working at <a href="https://www.studiocollab.ca/">Studio Collab</a> on days when I have meetings scheduled. It's been a 5/5 experienceâ€”works really well.</p>

                                        <p>The climbing access is great, and I have had no issues getting on projects after work. Another 5/5.</p>

                                        <p>Van camping is fine here with a lot of options, albeit a bit busy at this time of year. A 3/5 rating feels a bit harsh, but it requires some effort.</p>

                                        <p>The weather this time of year is perfect, so it's a solid 5/5.</p>

                                        <p>The community has been really great too. No issues finding partners, lots of familiar faces in the parking lots, and a lot of fun events beyond climbing. The community feels like a large part of what I am enjoying here. Again, a 5/5.</p>

                                        <h4><strong>Side Projects</strong></h4>
                                        <p>In terms of my side projects, I have made some progress. I finished a bag for a friend in nevada that I am really proud of. I would say it's possibly my best work yet. The production quality feels higher than my previous bags, but I took my time and tried to be really meticulous with it.</p>

                                        <p>I have also implemented more changes to the crash pad rental site. I tried to secure a first customer (with me renting out my pads to someone traveling to BC). It almost worked and we had a deal arranged, but he backed out at the last second. My guess is that he realized how many people have pads here and that he probably didnâ€™t need more than the one he had. I plan to follow up with him after his trip and ask him some questions/get some feedback on the site itself.</p>

                                        <p>It's been a bit harder to find time to work on things because I have been really maximizing my social interactions and spending a lot of time in the parking lots.</p>

                                        <p>Ultimately, this feels fine as long as I can continue to make incremental progress on both my craft and the site!</p>

                                    <h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
                                    <p>Iâ€™m writing this blog to follow along as I work on trying to start a successful small business.</p>
                                    <p>Iâ€™m not sure what shape it will take over time, but Iâ€™ll try to update with progress as I go and see what
                                        lessons I learn along the way.</p>

                                    <h4><strong>Attempt 1. Wedding Planning Software (defunct)</strong></h4>
                                    <p>This was one of the first things I tried to build after getting a job as a software engineer. The idea
                                        was to make a template editor that
                                        would allow one to send out wedding invitations that had QR codes that you could scan to make your
                                        reservation.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Why didnâ€™t it work?</strong></p>
                                    <p>I think I donâ€™t identify with the problem nor care to solve it, so it made it hard to want to deep
                                        iterate on it.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Takeaway</strong></p>
                                    <p>Try to work on things where I care about solving the problem and am more familiar with the problem space
                                    </p>
                                    <h4><strong>Attempt 2. Carrot Threadworks (active)</strong></h4>
                                    <p>I started making myself backpacks for climbing and eventually moved on to making bags for my friends
                                        as well. Over time, this has slowly grown into a business-ish pursuit?</p>
                                    <p>Itâ€™s very time-intensive and has very bad scaling properties.</p>
                                    <p><strong>Current Status</strong></p>
                                    <p>On the pro-side, itâ€™s very tangible to make progress, the value proposition to people is relatively
                                        clear, and itâ€™s personally fun for me to make the bags.</p>
                                    <p>At this point, this probably nets me -100 dollars per month with a clear path to breaking even. Most
                                        people at this point offer to pay when they get a bag, but I often defer in hopes of evangelizing a
                                        base of people who will advocate for me. I sometimes think this is a crutch to avoid the pressure of
                                        actually selling people something and dealing with their expectations then.</p>

                                    <p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
                                    <p>Make coffee money on bag sales and feel comfortable with the process</p>

                                    <p><strong>Takeaway</strong></p>
                                    <p>This is a really fun project to work on, but scaling is very hard without spending more time. Software projects scale
                                        way easier.</p>
                                    <h4><strong>Attempt 3. RentACrashPad (active)</strong></h4>
                                    <p>The goal of this project is to make it easy to rent crash pads at bouldering locations. I hope for it to become a common place
                                        where people go to look for rentals (currently, it's a patchwork of local shops/gyms/people, and it's hard to find who actually is renting the pads out). </p>

                                    <p><strong>Current Status</strong></p>
                                    <p>I'm still working on finishing the MVP and trying to come up with a way to get some number of users.</p>
                                    <p>This currently yields -12 dollars per month in hosting fees</p>
                                    <p><strong>Next Steps</strong></p>
                                    <p>Finish MVP and try to incentivize people in Las Vegas and Chattanooga to list their crash pads</p>
                                    <p><strong>Takeaway</strong></p>
                                    <p>Starting a marketplace feels hard because you have to get over a critical mass of people listing their items on your site.
                                        I imagine I will need to incentivize people to actually post in the first place</p>
